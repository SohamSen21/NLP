# Natural Language Processing

Aiming to master many natural language processing(NLP) capabilities. NLP is performed on text collections, composed of Tweets, Facebook posts, conversations, movie reviews, Shakespeare's plays, historic documents, news items, meeting logs, and so much more. A text collection is known as **corpus**, the plural of which is **corpora**.
Natural language lacks mathematical precision. Nuances of meaning make natural language understanding difficult.

### TextBlob

**TextBlob** is an object-oriented NLP text-processing library that is built on the **NLTK** and **pattern** NLP libraries and simplifies many of their capabilities. Some of the NLP tasks TextBlob can perform include : 
1. **Tokenization** - splitting text into pieces called **tokens**, which are meaningful units, such as words and numbers.
2. **Parts-of-speech (POS) tagging** - identifying each word's part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.
3. **Noun phrase extraction** - locating groups of words that represent nouns, such as "red brick factory".
4. **Sentiment Analysis** - determining whether text has positive, neutral or negative sentiment.
5. **Inter-language translation and language detection** - powered by Google Translate.
6. **Inflection** 
7. **Spell checking and spelling correction** 
8. **Stemming** 
9. **Lemmatization** 
10. **Word frequencies**
11. **WordNet integration**  
12. **Stop word elimination** 
13. **n-grams**

Many of these capabilities are used as part of more complex NLP tasks.
